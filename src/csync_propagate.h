/**

 *
 * @brief Propagation
 *
 * It uses the calculated records to apply them on the current replica. The
 * propagator uses a two-phase-commit mechanism to simulate an atomic
 * filesystem operation.
 *
 * In the first phase we copy the file to a temporary file on the opposite
 * replica. This has the advantage that we can check if file which has been
 * copied to the opposite replica has been transfered successfully. If the
 * connection gets interrupted during the transfer we still have the original
 * states of the file. This means no data will be lost.
 *
 * In the second phase the file on the opposite replica will be overwritten by
 * the temporary file.
 *
 * After a successful propagation we have to merge the trees to reflect the
 * current state of the filesystem tree. This updated tree will be written as a
 * journal into the state database. It will be used during the update detection
 * of the next synchronization. See above for a description of the state
 * database during synchronization.
